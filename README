LinkShare FastCGI program

Share links over the web.

This is the processing program which takes submissions from the lsbweb front end, and stores them in a critbit tree. The output is in the form of javascript files which are included by the frontend.

Another form of output is specific entries (searches) from the critbit structure which is dynamically generated as javascript.




There is also a sort value which is in hexadecimal and signifies a vote number.
The critbit tree will index them in order since the sort value is first.
So pulling out the first 100 entries of the tree will be the most popular entries.
